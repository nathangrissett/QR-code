## Overview

This is a webpage with a QR code for Frontend Mentor's website and some text about it. Updated to include proper usage of flexbox to center the card. Credit to @FazeenIjaz on Frontend Mentor for explaining to me that I need a container class for flexbox to work properly!

## My process

I started with writing the HTML only. I put the image on top of the text. All contents are contained in the body (no header or footer). I used h1 and h2 for my text elements.

I then wrote the CSS, in this order: 
1. resized the image.
2. installed and embedded the font
3. added padding and line heights to the text elements/classes
4. added borders
5. added colors
6. used flexbox to center the card (again, credit to @FazeenIjaz for explaining exactly how to do this)

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
